## Introduction
The *Threat Exposure Analysis Tool* (TEA-Tool) was developed as part of a bachelor thesis project 
to explore the *Intelligence Gathering* phase of a cyberattack or security assessment with a defensive perspective.

In cybersecurity, an organization's digital footprint is often the first target during reconnaissance by *Threat Actors* (TAs).
The TEA-Tool aims to provide a continuous or on-demand overview of this external exposure by:

- Identifying publicly accessible IPs, ports, and services
- Highlighting potential vulnerabilities and relevant metadata
- Leveraging *Tactics, Techniques & Procedures* (TTPs) from established security assessment methodologies
- Giving a comprehensive overview of the resulting exposure
- CLI-based interface for quick access and automation

This tool empowers IT security teams with actionable insights to enhance their threat intelligence and overall security posture.

>*"You can't protect what you don't know about."*


## Requirements
- Python 3.12 or higher
- A SHODAN API Key:
    - [Get your API key for free here](https://account.shodan.io/)
    - TEA-Tool works with a free SHODAN account, but a paid account is recommended for a broader discovery results.
- A `.env` file within the root directory of the TEA-Tool repository.
  - This file is used to store your SHODAN API key and other configuration settings, see [Configuration](#Configuration) for more details.
  - Not directly required, but sets the API key persistently for the tool.
- This guide assumes a Linux environment (Debian-based), but the tool works on Windows as well.


## Installation
Clone the repository as normal:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fleischrr/TEA-Tool.git
```
It is recommended to use a Virtualenv to avoid dependency conflicts with other Python projects.
For installation methods not using Virtualenv, you already know what you're doing.

Verify or install Python Virtualenv with (note Python v3.12 is used in this example):
```bash
sudo apt install python3.12-venv
```

Create and activate Virtualenv:
```bash
python3 -m venv .teaenv && \ 
source .teaenv/bin/activate
```

Install `requirements.txt` when Virtualenv is active:
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```


## Usage
The TEA-Tool is designed to be run from the *Command Line Interface* (CLI).
It can be used in two ways: **Main Usage** and **Headless Usage**, 
where the **Main Usage** is the default and recommended method for most users:

- [Main Usage](#Main-Usage)
- [Headless Usage](#Headless-Usage)


### Main Usage

This will display the TEA-Tool's main menu *User Interface* (UI) with instructions.
More explanation of the tool's UI usage is available within the main menu,
or in the documentations under the docs folder.

Launch the tool with:
```bash
python tea_tool.py
```

This will display one of three  main menus, depending on terminal size, where you can choose between the TEA-Tool's features:

</p>


### Headless Usage

To use exportation and automation/headless operations, use the tool's available headless CLI arguments.
These arguments do not require the main menu UI to be displayed, which allows for automation and scheduled scans.

These arguments can be viewed with the `-h` or `--help` flag:
```bash
python tea_tool.py -h
```
```
usage: tea_tool.py [-h] [-s ../path/to/config.json | -x ../path/to/output.csv]

The TEA-Tool.
An open-source Threat Exposure Analysis CLI Tool.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit

Optional arguments:
  Headless options to schedule scans or export data.

  -s, --schedule ../path/to/config.json
                        Schedule configuration file path
  -x, --export ../path/to/output.csv
                        Path to exported TEA exposure data (CSV format)
```

### Docker ( WIP )

Here is an example to use container as environment

Build and run:
```bash
docker compose build

docker compose up -d

docker compose exec tea-tool bash
```

Now you are running inside container, start it by type:
```
python tea_tool.py
```

## Features
- **Discovery Scan**: Uses SHODAN and HackerTarget to identify hostnames, IPs, and ASNs.
- **Full Scan**: Builds on Discovery Scan with the retrieval of port, service, vulnerability and other metadata.
- **Exposure Viewer**: Summarizes or details the exposure found.
- **Scheduled Scans**: Run scans automatically using a saved configuration file.
- **CSV Export**: Export exposure results to a CSV file for further analysis.


## Configuration
The configuration file is read from the root directory with the file name `.env`.
This file is not included in the repository for security reasons.

The file is structured as follows:
```
SHODAN_API_KEY=your_api_key    # REQUIRED
EXPOSURE_DB_PATH=/custom/path/to/db.sqlite    # Optional
LOG_PATH=/custom/path/to/    # Optional
```

**Explanation**
- `SHODAN_API_KEY`: Your SHODAN API key. This is required for the tool to function. ([Get your API key for free here](https://account.shodan.io/))
- `EXPOSURE_DB_PATH`: Optional path for the SQLite database file. If not specified, the default path is used.
- `LOG_PATH`: Optional path for the log file. If not specified, the default path is used.

> A paid SHODAN account is *recommended* for a broader host discovery, but is **not required**.
