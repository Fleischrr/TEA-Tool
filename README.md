# TEA-Tool

*"Design and implement an automated tool that continuously or manually monitors externally accessible information about an organization or company, promptly notifying stakeholders of newly discovered or previously unidentified public information."*

---

An organization’s digital presence is the first layer of its infrastructure from a *Threat Actor's* (TA) point of view. Information on this exposure is often retrieved in an *intelligence gathering* phase of a cyberattack or security assessments. This project was started to explore this initial phase of attack, but with a defensive perspective. By utilizing multiple *Tactics, Techniques & Procedures* (TTPs) from different security assessments and penetration testing methodologies, to gather intelligence on a organization’s digital infrastructure. The project started the development of the *Threat Exposure Analysis* (TEA) Tool that was spawned from the need to have an overview of this external exposure. The purpose of the TEA-Tool is to automatically identify which parts of an organization’s digital presence are publicly visible, by monitoring elements like public IPs, open ports, possible vulnerabilities, subnets, ASN and more. The tool should give IT Security teams a clearer understanding of their digital presence and enable them to include insightful information in *Threat Intelligence* (TI) reports, or other similar forums, to strengthen their overall security posture.

This is the main purpose of the tool, to serve as a help or mitigation step towards understanding the external digital presence of an organization. Assisting IT Security assets to make informed steps towards hardening their organization's external threat exposure.
