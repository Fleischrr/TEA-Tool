# *Threat Exposure Analysis* (TEA) Tool

*"Design and implement an automated tool that continuously or manually monitors externally accessible information about an organization or company, promptly notifying stakeholders of newly discovered or previously unidentified public information."*

---

An organization’s digital presence is the first layer of its infrastructure from an external *Threat Actor’s* (TA) point of view. Information on this exposure is often retrieved in an *Intelligence Gathering* phase of a cyberattack or information security assessments, also referred to as a penetration test. This tought was the start for my bachelor thesies and project, a project that explores the initial intelligence gathering phase, but with a defensive perspective. Exploring how the information gained from this phase can be applied defensively, by utilizing multiple *Tactics, Techniques & Procedures* (TTPs) from different security assessment methodologies to gather intelligence on a object's (e.g., a comany, org or hosts) external digital infrastructure.

This project described and followed the planning, development and usage of the *Threat Exposure Analysis* (TEA) Tool, that spawned from the need to have a living overview of the external exposure found. The purpose of the TEA-Tool is to automatically identify which parts of an object’s digital presence are publicly visible, by monitoring elements like public IPs, open ports, possible vulnerabilities and more. Incorporating different TTPs that were found viable by exploring these different information security assessments prior in the project. This tool should give stakeholders (e.g., IT Security teams) a clearer understanding of their digital presence and enable them to include insightful information in their *Threat Intelligence* (TI) reports, or other similar forums, to strengthen their overall security posture.
